# Reference files

## 1. Recommended: Uri property use pack uri

  - Pack uri are defined by WPF application : [See reference: Pack URIs in WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/app-development/pack-uris-in-wpf)

  - Neutronium fully support this kind of uri.

  - Syntax:
    To reference file `"View\Main\dist\index.html"` use `"pack://application:,,,/View/Main/dist/index.html"`.

  Example:

``` HTML
<wpf:HTMLViewControl Uri="pack://application:,,,/View/Main/dist/index.html">
</wpf:HTMLViewControl>
```

- Referenced files should have a 
  - `Resource` build type
  -  Preferably `None` Copy to Output type.
- All other files referenced by the root file the same properties.
- This way HTML files will be embedded in the application and not visible from the outside of the assembly when deploying.

## 2. Deprecated: RelativeSource and relative path to the file.

-**Important: Deprecated and removed in future Neutronium version, please use and  migrate to pack uri.**

- Referenced files should have a 
  - `Content` build type
  - `Copy Always` Copy to Output type.

- Build vue file generated by [vue-cli-neutronium](https://github.com/NeutroniumCore/vue-cli-plugin-neutronium) are not compatible with this mode.
- These files are not embedded in the assembly and will be exposed during deploy.
